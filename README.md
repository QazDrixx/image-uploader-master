## Overview

![screenshot](/static/img/solution-screenshot.png)

<!-- Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

- Where can I see your demo?
- What was your experience?
- What have you learned/improved?
- Your wisdom? :) -->

### Built With

<!-- This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Here are a few examples.-->

- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/)

## Features

<!-- List the features of your application or follow the template. Don't share the figma file here :) -->

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/O2iGT9yBd6xZBrOcVirx) was to build an application to complete the given user stories.

## How To Use

<!-- Example: -->

To clone and run this application, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Python](https://www.python.org) installed on your computer. From your command line:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/your-user-name/your-project-name

#Create a virtual environment
For windows: $ python -m venv venv <br/>
For Unix/Linux: $ python3 -m venv venv

#Activate the virtual environment
For windows: $ python -m venv\Scripts\activate.ps1 <br/>
For Unix/Linux: $ source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the app
$ flask run
```

## Future Development Plans
<b>Migrate to React and Django:</b> Rewrite the existing web application using the React JavaScript library for the frontend and the Django framework for the backend.

<b>User Authentication and Authorization:</b> Implement a user authentication system using Django's built-in authentication.

<b>View and Delete Uploaded Images:</b> Develop a feature that allows authenticated users to view and delete their uploaded images. Each user will have a dedicated image gallery showcasing their uploaded photos, and they will be able to manage their gallery by removing any unwanted images.
